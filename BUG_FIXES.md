# Bug Fixes Documentation

## Critical Bugs Fixed

This document outlines the critical bugs that were identified and fixed in the FixitV2 Server codebase.

### 1. Import Path Issues

**Problem**: `authMiddleware.js` was importing `asyncHandler` from an incorrect relative path.
- **Error**: `require('./asyncHandler')` 
- **Fix**: Changed to `require('../utils/asyncHandler')`
- **Impact**: Server would crash on startup due to missing module

### 2. Missing Error Handler Function

**Problem**: `errorMiddleware.js` was missing the `notFound` function but it was being imported elsewhere.
- **Error**: Module only exported `errorHandler` but code expected `{ errorHandler, notFound }`
- **Fix**: Added `notFound` function and updated module exports
- **Impact**: Server would crash when trying to handle 404 errors

### 3. Case Sensitivity in Controller Import

**Problem**: `rentRoutes.js` was importing `rentController` but file was named `RentController.js`.
- **Error**: `require('../controllers/rentController')`
- **Fix**: Changed to `require('../controllers/RentController')`
- **Impact**: Server would crash on startup due to module not found

### 4. Duplicate Route Mounting

**Problem**: Units routes were mounted twice in `server.js`.
- **Error**: Both `/api/units` and `/api/properties` were mounting the same routes
- **Fix**: Removed duplicate mount point
- **Impact**: Route conflicts and unexpected behavior

### 5. External Service Configuration Dependencies

**Problem**: Server would crash if external service credentials were not configured.

#### Google OAuth
- **Error**: Server crashed if `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`, or `GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI` were missing
- **Fix**: Made Google Auth optional with graceful degradation
- **Impact**: Server can now start without Google OAuth configured

#### SMS Gateway (Africa's Talking)
- **Error**: Server crashed if `AT_USERNAME` or `AT_API_KEY` were missing
- **Fix**: Made SMS functionality optional with graceful degradation
- **Impact**: Server can now start without SMS configured

#### Cloudinary
- **Error**: Server crashed if Cloudinary credentials were missing
- **Fix**: Made file upload functionality optional with graceful degradation
- **Impact**: Server can now start without Cloudinary configured

### 6. Missing Environment Configuration

**Problem**: No `.env` file was present, causing startup failures.
- **Fix**: Created comprehensive `.env` file with all required variables
- **Impact**: Server can now start with default configuration

### 7. Server Configuration Conflicts

**Problem**: Two different server configurations (`app.js` and `server.js`) existed.
- **Fix**: Moved conflicting `app.js` to `app.js.backup` and cleaned up `server.js`
- **Impact**: Single, consistent server configuration

## Testing

Added comprehensive test suite to validate all bug fixes:
- Module import tests
- External service integration tests
- Route import tests
- Configuration validation tests

All tests pass successfully, ensuring the fixes work as expected.

## Security Improvements

- Fixed brace-expansion vulnerability via `npm audit fix`
- Remaining vulnerabilities are in external dependencies (africastalking â†’ validate.js)

## Environment Variables

The server now supports the following environment variables:

```env
# Required
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/fixitv2
JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret

# Optional - Google OAuth
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-google-client-id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-google-client-secret
GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:5000/auth/google/callback

# Optional - SMS Gateway
AT_USERNAME=your-africastalking-username
AT_API_KEY=your-africastalking-api-key

# Optional - Cloudinary
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your-cloudinary-cloud-name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your-cloudinary-api-key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your-cloudinary-api-secret

# Optional - Email
EMAIL_USER=your-email@example.com
EMAIL_PASS=your-email-password

# Optional - General
NODE_ENV=development
PORT=5000
```

The server will now start successfully with just `MONGO_URI` and `JWT_SECRET` configured, with all other services gracefully degrading when not configured.
